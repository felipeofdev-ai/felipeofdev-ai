## 🎯 What I Do

Backend Python Developer specialized in **APIs, AI integrations, and production-grade automation**.

**My edge?** 6 years in **ICU/Emergency environments** where downtime means lives lost.

I bring that same **zero-error mindset** to software:

```python
# Code that works isn't enough. It needs to:
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Fail loudly when it should
- Stay maintainable at 2 AM
- Respect data privacy by default (LGPD/GDPR)
```

**I don't write code for demos. I write code for Monday mornings.**

## 💡 Why Hire Me?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔹 **I Understand Production Stakes**

6 years in environments where:
- Errors have real consequences
- Systems must run 24/7
- Data privacy is non-negotiable
- Protocols exist for a reason

**Result:** I write defensive code with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔹 **I Solve Real Problems**

I don't build for portfolios.

My projects address actual business needs:
- Decision support systems
- Financial traceability
- Process automation
- AI that adds measurable value

**Result:** Code that ships and stays running.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔹 **I Communicate Clearly**

Technical skills matter. So does:
- Explaining complexity to non-tech stakeholders
- Writing documentation that others can follow
- Coordinating across teams

**Background:** Interfaced with doctors, families, and ops teams daily.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔹 **I'm Self-Driven**

Career transition? **Self-taught.**  
Portfolio? **Built from scratch.**  
Learning curve? **I climb it daily.**

**Evidence:**
- 8 repos in 2 months
- 125+ commits

## 🎯 Career Transition: From Healthcare to Tech

**2017-2023: ICU/Emergency Nursing Technician**  
*SPDM Municipal Hospital*

**What I learned that translates to software:**

| Healthcare Skill | Tech Equivalent |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Zero-error protocols | Unit testing, code reviews, defensive programming |
| SLA-driven operations | Uptime monitoring, CI/CD, incident response |
| Data privacy (LGPD/PII) | Security best practices, encryption, compliance |
| High-pressure decision-making | Debugging under deadlines, root cause analysis |
| Cross-team coordination | Agile ceremonies, clear documentation, stakeholder management |

**Why I transitioned:**  
I was already solving problems — protocols, workflows, data integrity.  
Now I do it with Python instead of spreadsheets.

## 📫 What I'm Looking For

### ✅ **YES**
- Backend / Python roles (junior to mid-level)
- AI/automation-focused teams building real products
- Remote-first companies valuing ownership over titles
- Regulated industries (fintech, healthtech, compliance) where my background adds value
- Teams that ship code, not just talk about it

### ❌ **NO**
- Agencies doing client work without product ownership
- "Ninja rockstar guru" job descriptions
- Unpaid internships or "exposure" offers
- Companies without clear engineering practices
